# ASTRO
Monitoring tool for AWS lambda services

# MOTIVATIONS

Serverless is becoming increasingly popular in today's tech landscape, especially as it can offer crucial cost-effective benefits since serverless functions are billed when they are invoked. Additionally, Amazon's Web Services (AWS) is a giant in the serverless space and is widely utilized by various companies. However, navigating through the AWS console is extremely daunting, difficult, and at times inefficient. Specifically, to measure a user's lambda functions, there are too many options and this massive flexibility proves cumbersome when one only needs to visualize specific metrics at a glance.

Astro is a free, open-source lambda function monitoring tool that users can connect their AWS account to securely and easily to monitor and track key metrics.
